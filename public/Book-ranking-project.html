    <h1>Favourite Sci-fi Books</h1>
<h2>A round up of the best science fiction books I read in 2022</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Space Between Worlds <br />by Micaiah Johnson</h3>
<p>So good I read it twice! This novel features a queer relationship as well as space travel. Loved it!</p>
<h3>Every Version of You <br/>by Grace Chan</h3>
<p>I discovered this one through IndyReads because they were hosting this as a book club. <br />
    Without that I may not have even heard of it and missed a really interesting read!</p>
<h3>Battle of the Linguist Mages <br />by Scotto Moore</h3>
<p>Now this one was a strange one! I hadn't read anything of his before this dark, adventurous audiobook was engaging for sure.</p>
<h3>Hench <br />by Natalie Zina Walschots</h3>
<p>Yet another 'new for me author' from whom I am eager for a sequel.</p>
