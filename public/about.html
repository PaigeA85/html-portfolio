  <h1>About Me: Paige</h1>
<p>I'm an educator with an arts degree who recently decided to finally learn to code. I'm an Australian who has lived in 3 states and plans to visit 3 more in the next 5 years. I am a dog lover who was adopted by a cat, an an avid reader who will argue that graphic novels count as books AND I'm a queer, feminist woman.</p>

<p>I'm a sci-f- mega nerd who is also kind of a geek. Even though I have barely scratched the surface, learning to code has been an exciting adventure. I am hoping to work in tech one day. </p>
