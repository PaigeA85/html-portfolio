    <h1>It's my birthday!</h1>
<h2>Extra advance notice for my upcoming 40th in 18 months</h2>
<p>So I know this goes against the grain but I decided to plan my 40th birthday now, so that I will have less to worry about while I am 39. This is a celebration of survival and achievement. I haven't celebrated since my 30th and I would really love to have you there!</p>
